# Product_strategies_AI_automation
AI-powered strategy engine that automated ~80% of PMs’ initial market/user research—enabling instant generation of growth, retention, and monetization ideas that previously took teams 3–5 hours per product.
Integrated Sheets → Webhooks → OpenAI pipeline to turn raw product metadata into real-time strategy recommendations, reducing iteration loops and helping PMs validate hypotheses faster.
